<p>India – Size and Location</p>
<p>India is one of the ancient civilizations in the world. It has achieved multi-faceted socio-economic progress during the last five decades. It has moved forward displaying remarkable progress in the field of agriculture, industry, technology and overall economic development. India has also contributed significantly to the making of world history.</p>
<p>Location</p>
<p>India is a vast country. Lying entirely in the Northern hemisphere (Figure 1.1) the mainland extends between latitudes 8°4&#x27;N and 37°6&#x27;N and longitudes 68°7&#x27;E and 97°25&#x27;E.</p>
<p>The Tropic of Cancer (23° 30&#x27;N) divides the country into almost two equal parts. To the southeast and southwest of the mainland, lie the Andaman and Nicobar islands and the Lakshadweep islands in Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea respectively. Find out the extent of these groups of islands from your atlas.</p>

<p>The southernmost point of the Indian Union- &#x27;Indira Point&#x27; got submerged under the sea water in 2004 during the Tsunami.</p>
<p>Size</p>
<p>The land mass of India has an area of 3.28 million square km. India&#x27;s total area accounts for about 2.4 per cent of the total geographical</p>

<p>- Why 82°30&#x27;E has been selected as the Standard Meridian of India?<br>- Why is the difference between the durations of day and night hardly felt at Kanniya-kumari but not so in Kashmir?</p>
<p>India and the World</p>
<p>The Indian landmass has a central location between the East and the West Asia. India is a southward extension of the Asian continent. The trans Indian Ocean routes, which connect the countries of Europe in the west and the countries of East Asia, provide a strategic central location to India. Note that the Deccan Peninsula protrudes into the Indian Ocean, thus helping India to establish close contact with West Asia, Africa and Europe from the western coast and with Southeast and East Asia from the eastern coast. No other country has a long coastline on the Indian Ocean as India has and indeed, it is India&#x27;s eminent position in the Indian Ocean, which justifies the naming of an Ocean after it.</p>
<p>Do You Know?</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, India&#x27;s distance from Europe has been reduced by 7,000 km.</p>

<p>India&#x27;s contacts with the World have continued through ages but her relationships through the land routes are much older than her maritime contacts. The various passes across the mountains in the north have provided passages to the ancient travellers, while the oceans restricted such interaction for a long time.</p>
<p>These routes have contributed in the exchange of ideas and commodities since ancient times. The ideas of the Upanishads and the Ramayana, the stories of Panchatantra, the Indian numerals and the decimal system thus could reach many parts of the world. The spices, muslin and other merchandise were taken from India to different countries. On the other hand, the influence of Greek sculpture, and the architectural styles of dome and minarets from West Asia can be seen in different parts of our country.</p>
<p>India&#x27;s Neighbours</p>
<p>India occupies an important strategic position in South Asia. India has 28 states and Eight Union Territories (Figure 1.5).</p>
<p>Find Out</p>
<p>- The number of Union Territories along the western and eastern coasts.<br>- Area-wise which is the smallest and which is the largest state?<br>- The states which do not have an international border or lie on the coast.<br>- Classify the states into four groups each having common frontiers with (i) Pakistan, (ii) China, (iii) Myanmar, and (iv) Bangladesh.</p>
<p>India shares its land boundaries with Pakistan and Afghanistan in the northwest, China (Tibet), Nepal and Bhutan in the north and Myanmar and Bangladesh in the east. Our southern neighbours across the sea consist of the two island countries, namely</p>
<p>Do You Know?</p>
<p>Before 1947, there were two types of states in India — the provinces and the Princely states. Provinces were ruled directly by British officials, who were appointed by the Viceroy. Princely states were ruled by local, hereditary rulers, who acknowledged sovereignty in return for local autonomy.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka and Maldives. Sri Lanka is separated from India by a narrow channel of sea formed by the Palk Strait and the Gulf of Mannar, while Maldives Islands are situated to the south of the Lakshadweep Islands.</p>
<p>India has had strong geographical and historical links with her neighbours. Look at the physical map of Asia in your atlas, and note how India stands apart from the rest of Asia.</p>
