<p>4<br>DATA HANDLING AND PRESENTATION</p>
<p>If you ask your classmates about their favourite colours, you will get a list of colours. This list is an example of data. Similarly, if you measure the weight of each student in your class, you would get a collection of measures of weight—again data.</p>
<p>Any collection of facts, numbers, measures, observations or other descriptions of things that convey information about those things is called data.</p>
<p>We live in an age of information. We constantly see large amounts of data presented to us in new and interesting ways. In this chapter, we will explore some of the ways that data is presented, and how we can use some of those ways to correctly display, interpret and make inferences from such data!</p>
<p>4.1 Collecting and Organising Data</p>
<p>Navya and Naresh are discussing their favourite games.</p>
<p>Cricket is my favourite game!</p>
<p>I play cricket sometimes but hockey is the game I like the most.</p>
<p>I think cricket is the most popular game in our class.</p>
<p>I am not sure. How can we find the most popular game in our class?</p>
<p>Data Handling and Presentation</p>
<p>To figure out the most popular game in their class, what should Navya and Naresh do? Can you help them?</p>
<p>Naresh and Navya decided to go to each student in the class and ask what their favorite game is. Then they prepared a list. Navya is showing the list:</p>
<p>Mehnoor – Kabaddi  <br>Jubimon – Hockey  <br>Simran – Kabaddi  <br>Nand – Satoliya (Pittu)  <br>Ankita – Kabaddi  <br>Imon – Hockey  <br>Yuvraj – Cricket  <br>Rehana – Hockey  <br>Aarna – Badminton  <br>Kompal – Football  <br>Tahira – Cricket  <br>Pushkal – Satoliya (Pittu)  <br>Densy – Badminton  <br>Jivika – Satoliya (Pittu)  <br>Leela – Hockey  <br>Afshan – Hockey  <br>Keerat – Cricket  <br>Gurpreet – Hockey  <br>Arsh – Kabaddi  <br>Bhavya – Cricket  <br>Sarah – Kabaddi  <br>Anaya – Kabaddi  <br>Jivisha – Satoliya (Pittu)  <br>Rajesh – Football  <br>Thara – Football  <br>Soumya – Cricket  <br>Navjot – Hockey  <br>Hemal – Satoliya (Pittu)  <br>Debabrata – Football  <br>Annaya – Hockey  <br>Hardik – Cricket  </p>
<p>She says (happily), “I have collected the data. I can figure out the most popular game now!”.</p>
<p>A few other children are looking at the list and wondering, “We can’t yet see the most popular game. How can we get it from this list?”.</p>
<p>Figure it Out</p>
<p>1. What would you do to find the most popular game among Naresh’s and Navya’s classmates?<br>2. What is the most popular game in their class?<br>3. Try to find out the most popular game among your classmates.<br>4. Pari wants to respond to the questions given below. Put a tick (✓) for the questions where she needs to carry out data collection and analysis.</p>
<p>Ganita Prakash | Grade 6</p>
<p>put a cross (✗) for the questions where she doesn’t need to collect data. Discuss your answers in the classroom.</p>
<p>a. What is the most popular TV show among her classmates? □<br>b. When did India get independence? □<br>c. How much water is getting wasted in her locality? □<br>d. What is the capital of India? □</p>
<p>Shri Nilesh is a teacher. He decided to bring sweets to the class to celebrate the new year. The sweets shop nearby has jalebi, gulab jamun, gujiya, barfi, and rasgulla. He wanted to know the choices of the children. He wrote the names of the sweets on the board and asked each child to tell him their preference. He put a tally mark ‘|’ for each student and when the count reached 5, he put a line through the previous four and marked it as ‘’.</p>
<p>| Sweets      | Tally Marks      | No. of Students |<br>|-------------|------------------|-----------------|<br>| Jalebi      | |||| |           | 6               |<br>| Gulab jamun | |||| |||         | 9               |<br>| Gujiya      | |||| |||| |||    |                 |<br>| Barfi       | |||              |                 |<br>| Rasgulla    | |||| ||          |                 |</p>
<p>Figure it Out</p>
<p>1. Complete the table to help Shri Nilesh to purchase the correct numbers of sweets:<br>a. How many students chose jalebi? _______<br>b. Barfi was chosen by _______ students?<br>c. How many students chose gujiya? _______<br>d. Rasgulla was chosen by _______ students?<br>e. How many students chose gulab jamun? _______</p>
<p>Data Handling and Presentation</p>
<p>Shri Nilesh requested one of the staff members to bring the sweets as given in the table. The above table helped him to purchase the correct numbers of sweets.</p>
<p>2. Is the above table sufficient to distribute each type of sweet to the correct student? Explain. If it is not sufficient, what is the alternative?</p>
<p>To organise the data, we can write the name of each sweet in one column and using tally signs, note the number of students who prefer that sweet. The numbers 6, 9, ... are the frequencies of the sweet preferences for jalebi, gulab jamun ... respectively.</p>
<p>Sushri Sandhya asked her students about the sizes of the shoes they wear. She noted the data on the board.</p>
<p>4 5 3 4 3 4 5 5 4<br>5 5 4 5 6 4 5 3 5 6<br>4 6 4 5 7 5 6 5 4 5</p>
<p>She then arranged the shoe sizes of the students in ascending order — 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7</p>
<p>Figure it Out</p>
<p>1. Help her to figure out the following:<br>   a. The largest shoe size in the class is ________.<br>   b. The smallest shoe size in the class is ________.<br>   c. There are ________ students who wear shoe size 5.<br>   d. There are ________ students who wear shoe sizes larger than 4.</p>
<p>2. How did arranging the data in ascending order help to answer these questions?</p>
<p>3. Are there other ways to arrange the data?</p>
<p>4. Write the names of a few trees you see around you. When you observe a tree on the way from your home to school (or while walking from one place to another place), record the data and fill in the following table:</p>
<p>Tree | No. of Trees<br>---|---<br>Peepal |<br>Neem |<br>... |<br>.... |</p>
<p>a. Which tree was found in the greatest number?<br>b. Which tree was found in the smallest number?<br>c. Were there any two trees found in the same numbers?</p>
<p>5. Take a blank piece of paper and paste any small news item from a newspaper. Each student may use a different article. Now, prepare a table on the piece of paper as given below. Count the number of each of the letters ‘c’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘r’, and ‘x’ in the words of the news article, and fill in the table.</p>
<p>Letter | c | e | i | r | x | Any other letter of your choice<br>---|---|---|---|---|---|---<br>Number of times found in the news item | | | | | |</p>
<p>a. The letter found the most number of times is _______.<br>b. The letter found the least number of times is _______.<br>c. List the five letters ‘c’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘r’, ‘x’ in ascending order of frequency. Now, compare the order of your list with that of your classmates. Is your order the same or nearly the same as theirs? (Almost everyone is likely to get the order ‘x, c, r, i, e’.) Why do you think this is the case?</p>
<p>d. Write the process you followed to complete this task.</p>
<p>e. Discuss with your friends the processes they followed.</p>
<p>f. If you do this task with another news item, what process would you follow?</p>
<p>Teacher’s Note</p>
<p>Provide more opportunities to collect and organise data. Ask students to guess what is the most popular colour, game, toy, school subject, etc., amongst the students in their classroom and then collect the data for it. It can be a fun activity in which they also learn about their classmates. Discuss how they can organise the data in different ways, each way having its own advantages and limitations. For all these tasks and the tasks under ‘Figure it Out’, discuss the tasks with the children and let them understand the tasks, and then let them plan and present their research processes and conclusions in the class.</p>
<p>4.2 Pictographs</p>
<p>Pictographs are one visual and suggestive way to represent data without writing any numbers. Look at this picture — you may be familiar with it from previous classes.</p>
<p>This picture helps you understand at a glance the different modes of travel used by students. Based on this picture, answer the following questions:</p>
<p>- Which mode of travel is used by the most number of students?<br>- Which mode of travel is used by the least number of students?</p>
<p>A pictograph represents data through pictures of objects. It helps answer questions about data with just a quick glance.</p>
<p>In the above pictograph, one unit or symbol (☻) is used to represent one student. There are also other pictographs where one unit or symbol stands for many people or objects.</p>
<p>Example: Nand Kishor collected responses from the children of his middle school in Berasia regarding how often they slept at least 9 hours during the night. He prepared a pictograph from the data:</p>
<p>Response</p>
<p>Number of Children (▲ = 10 Children)</p>
<p>Always</p>
<p>Sometimes</p>
<p>Never</p>
<p>Answer the following questions using the pictograph:</p>
<p>1. What is the number of children who always slept at least 9 hours at night?<br>2. How many children sometimes slept at least 9 hours at night?<br>3. How many children always slept less than 9 hours each night? Explain how you got your answer.</p>
<p>Solutions</p>
<p>1. In the table, there are 5 pictures ▲ for ‘Always’. Each picture ▲ represents 10 children. Therefore, 5 pictures indicate 5 × 10 = 50 children.</p>
<p>2. There are 2 complete pictures ▲ (2 × 10 = 20) and a half picture ▲ (half of 10 = 5). Therefore, the number of children who sleep at least 9 hours only sometimes is 20 + 5 = 25.</p>
<p>Data Handling and Presentation</p>
<p>3. There are 4 complete pictures for ‘Never’. Hence, 4 × 10 = 40 children never sleep at least 9 hours in a night, i.e., they always sleep less than 9 hours.</p>
<p>Drawing a Pictograph</p>
<p>One day, Lakhanpal collected data on how many students were absent in each class:</p>
<p>Class: I II III IV V VI VII VIII<br>No. of students: 3 5 4 2 0 1 5 7</p>
<p>He created a pictograph to present this data and decided to show 1 student as 🙂 in the pictograph—</p>
<p>🙂 = 1 student</p>
<p>Classes<br>VIII 🙂 🙂 🙂 🙂 🙂 🙂 🙂<br>VII 🙂 🙂 🙂 🙂 🙂<br>VI 🙂<br>V<br>IV 🙂 🙂<br>III 🙂 🙂 🙂 🙂<br>II 🙂 🙂 🙂 🙂 🙂<br>I 🙂 🙂 🙂</p>
<p>No. of students absent</p>
<p>Meanwhile, his friends Jarina and Sangita collected data on how many students were present in each class:</p>
<p>Class: I II III IV V VI VII VIII<br>No. of students: 30 35 20 25 30 25 30 20</p>
<p>If they want to show their data through a pictograph, where they also use one symbol 🙂 for each student, as Lakhanpal did, what are the challenges they might face?</p>
<p>Jarina made a plan to address this — since there were many students, she decided to use 🙂 to represent 5 students. She figured that would save time and space too.</p>
<p>🙂 = 5 students</p>
<p>Sangita decided to use one 🙂 to represent 10 students instead.</p>
<p>Since she used one 🙂 to show 10 students, she had a problem in showing 25 students and 35 students in the pictograph. Then, she realised she could use 🙂 to show 5 students.</p>
<p>🙂 = 10 students</p>
<p>What could be the problems faced in preparing such a pictograph, if the total number of students present in a class is 33 or 27?</p>
<p>Pictographs are a nice visual and suggestive way to represent data. They represent data through pictures of objects.</p>
<p>Pictographs can help answer questions and make inferences about data with just a quick glance (in the examples above—about favourite games, favourite colours, most common modes of conveyance, number of students absent, etc.).</p>
<p>By reading a pictograph, we can quickly understand the frequencies of the different categories (for example, cricket, hockey, etc.) and the comparisons of these frequencies.</p>
<p>In a pictograph, the categories can be arranged horizontally or vertically. For each category, simple pictures and symbols are then drawn in the designated columns or rows according to the frequency of that category.</p>
<p>A scale or key (for example, 😊: 1 student or 😊: 5 students) is added to show what each symbol or picture represents. Each symbol or picture can represent one unit or multiple units.</p>
<p>It can be more challenging to prepare a pictograph when the amount of data is large or when the frequencies are not exact multiples of the scale or key.</p>
<p>Figure it Out</p>
<p>1. The following pictograph shows the number of books borrowed by students, in a week, from the library of Middle School, Ginnori:</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>Number of Books Borrowed</p>
<p>(📚=1 Book)</p>
<p>Monday</p>
<p>📚📚📚📚📚📚</p>
<p>Tuesday</p>
<p>📚📚📚📚📚</p>
<p>Wednesday</p>
<p>📚📚📚</p>
<p>Thursday</p>
<p>📚📚📚📚📚📚📚</p>
<p>Friday</p>
<p>📚📚📚📚📚📚📚📚</p>
<p>Saturday</p>
<p>📚📚📚📚📚📚📚📚📚📚📚📚📚📚</p>
<p>a. On which day were the minimum number of books borrowed?</p>
<p>b. What was the total number of books borrowed during the week?</p>
<p>c. On which day were the maximum number of books borrowed? What may be the possible reason?</p>
<p>2. Magan Bhai sells kites at Jamnagar. Six shopkeepers from nearby villages come to purchase kites from him. The number of kites he sold to these six shopkeepers are given below —</p>
<p>Shopkeeper</p>
<p>Number of Kites Sold</p>
<p>Chaman</p>
<p>250</p>
<p>Rani</p>
<p>300</p>
<p>Rukhsana</p>
<p>100</p>
<p>Jasmeet</p>
<p>450</p>
<p>Jetha Lal</p>
<p>250</p>
<p>Poonam Ben</p>
<p>700</p>
<p>Prepare a pictograph using the symbol 🪁 to represent 100 kites. Answer the following questions:<br>a. How many symbols represent the kites that Rani purchased?<br>b. Who purchased the maximum number of kites?<br>c. Who purchased more kites, Jasmeet or Chaman?<br>d. Rukhsana says Poonam Ben purchased more than double the number of kites that Rani purchased. Is she correct? Why?</p>
<p>4.3 Bar Graphs</p>
<p>Have you seen graphs like this on TV or in a newspaper?</p>
<p>Like pictographs, such bar graphs can help us to quickly understand and interpret information, such as the highest value, the comparison of values of different categories, etc. However, when the amount of data is large, presenting it by a pictograph is not only time consuming but at times difficult too. Let us see how data can be presented instead using a bar graph.</p>
<p>Let’s take the data collected by Lakhanpal earlier, regarding the number of students absent on one day in each class:</p>
<p>Class I II III IV V VI VII VIII<br>No. of students 3 5 4 2 0 1 5 7</p>
<p>He presented the same data using a bar graph:</p>
<p>Teacher’s Note</p>
<p>If the students have not noticed, please point out the equally spaced horizontal lines. Explain that this means that each pair of consecutive numbers on the left has the same gap.</p>
<p>Answer the following questions using the bar graph:</p>
<p>1. In Class 2, _____ students were absent that day.</p>
<p>2. In which class were the maximum number of students absent? _____</p>
<p>3. Which class had full attendance that day? _____</p>
<p>When making bar graphs, bars of uniform width can be drawn horizontally or vertically with equal spacing between them; then the</p>
<p>Data Handling and Presentation</p>
<p>Let us look at an example of vehicular traffic at a busy road crossing in Delhi, which was studied by the traffic police on a particular day. The number of vehicles passing through the crossing each hour from 6 a.m. to 12:00 noon is shown in the bar graph. One unit of length stands for 100 vehicles.</p>
<p>We can see that the maximum traffic at the crossing is shown by the longest bar, i.e., for the time interval 7–8 a.m. The bar graph shows that 1200 vehicles passed through the crossing at that time. The second longest bar is for 8–9 a.m. During that time, 1000 vehicles passed through the crossing. Similarly, the minimum traffic is shown by the smallest bar, i.e., the bar for the time interval 6–7 a.m. During that time, only about 150 vehicles passed through the crossing. The second smallest bar is that for the time interval 11 a.m.–12 noon, when about 600 vehicles passed through the crossing.</p>
<p>The total number of cars passing through the crossing during the two-hour interval 8.00–10.00 a.m. as shown by the bar graph is about 1000 + 800 = 1800 vehicles.</p>
<p>Figure it Out</p>
<p>1. How many total cars passed through the crossing between 6 a.m. and noon?</p>
<p>2. Why do you think so little traffic occurred during the hour of 6–7 a.m., as compared to the other hours from 7 a.m.–noon?</p>
<p>3. Why do you think the traffic was the heaviest between 7–8 a.m.?</p>
<p>4. Why do you think the traffic was lesser and lesser each hour after 8 a.m. all the way until noon?</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Population of India in crores</p>
<p>This bar graph shows the population of India in each decade over a period of 50 years. The numbers are expressed in crores. If you were to take 1 unit length to represent one person, drawing the bars will</p>
<p>Data Handling and Presentation</p>
<p>be difficult! Therefore, we choose the scale so that 1 unit represents 10 crores. The bar graph for this choice is shown in the figure. So a bar of length 5 units represents 50 crores and of 8 units represents 80 crores.</p>
<p>- On the basis of this bar graph, what may be a few questions you may ask your friends?<br>- How much did the population of India increase over 50 years? How much did the population increase in each decade?</p>
<p>4.4 Drawing a Bar Graph</p>
<p>In a previous example, Shri Nilesh prepared a frequency table representing the sweet preferences of the students in his class. Let’s try to prepare a bar graph to present his data —</p>
<p>1. First, we draw a horizontal line and a vertical line. On the horizontal line, we will write the name of each of the sweets, equally spaced, from which the bars will rise in accordance with their frequencies; and on the vertical line we will write the frequencies representing the number of students.</p>
<p>2. We must choose a scale. That means we must decide how many students will be represented by a unit length of a bar so that it fits nicely on our paper. Here, we will take 1 unit length to represent 1 student.</p>
<p>3. For jalebi, we therefore need to draw a bar having a height of 6 units (which is the frequency of the sweet jalebi), and similarly for the other sweets we have to draw bars as high as their frequencies.</p>
<p>4. We, therefore, get a bar graph as shown below—</p>
<p>Sweet preferences of students</p>
<p>When the frequencies are larger and we cannot use the scale of 1 unit length = 1 number (frequency), we need to choose a different scale like we did in the case of pictographs.</p>
<p>Example: The number of runs scored by Smriti in each of the 8 matches are given in the table below:</p>
<p>Match 1  Match 2  Match 3  Match 4  Match 5  Match 6  Match 7  Match 8  <br>Runs  80  50  10  100  90  0  90  50</p>
<p>In this example, the minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 100. Using a scale of 1 unit length = 1 run would mean that we have to go all the way from 0 to 100 runs in steps of 1. This would be unnecessarily tedious. Instead, let us use a scale where 1 unit length = 10 runs. We mark this scale on the vertical line and draw the bars according to the scores in each match. We get the following bar graph representing the above data.</p>
<p>Data Handling and Presentation</p>
<p>Example: The following table shows the monthly expenditure of Imran’s family on various items:</p>
<p>Items<br>Expenditure (in ₹)</p>
<p>House rent<br>3000</p>
<p>Food<br>3400</p>
<p>Education<br>800</p>
<p>Electricity<br>400</p>
<p>Transport<br>600</p>
<p>Miscellaneous<br>1200</p>
<p>To represent this data in the form of a bar graph, here are the steps—</p>
<p>- Draw two perpendicular lines, one horizontal and one vertical.<br>- Along the horizontal line, mark the ‘items’ with equal spacing between them and mark the corresponding expenditures along the vertical line.</p>
<p>- Take bars of the same width, keeping a uniform gap between them.<br>- Choose a suitable scale along the vertical line. Let, 1 unit length = ₹ 200, and then mark and write the corresponding values (₹ 200, ₹ 400, etc.) representing each unit length.</p>
<p>Finally, calculate the heights of the bars for various items as shown below—</p>
<p>House rent: 3000 ÷ 200 = 15 units  <br>Food: 3400 ÷ 200 = 17 units  <br>Education: 800 ÷ 200 = 4 units  <br>Electricity: 400 ÷ 200 = 2 units  <br>Transport: 600 ÷ 200 = 3 units  <br>Miscellaneous: 1200 ÷ 200 = 6 units  </p>
<p>Here is the bar graph that we obtain based on the above steps:</p>
<p>Data Handling and Presentation</p>
<p>Use the bar graph to answer the following questions:<br>1. On which item does Imran’s family spend the most and the second most?<br>2. Is the cost of electricity about one-half the cost of education?<br>3. Is the cost of education less than one-fourth the cost of food?</p>
<p>Figure it Out</p>

<p>11. The number of tigers in India went down drastically between 1900 and 1970. Project Tiger was launched in 1973 to track and protect the tigers in India. Starting in 2006, the exact number of tigers in India was tracked. Shagufta and Divya looked up information about the number of tigers in India between 2006 and 2022 in four-year intervals. They prepared a frequency table for this data and a bar graph to present this data, but there are a few mistakes in the graph. Can you find those mistakes and fix them?</p>
<p>Year | Number of Tigers (approx.)</p>
<p>2006 | 1400</p>
<p>2010 | 1700</p>
<p>2014 | 2200</p>
<p>2018 | 3000</p>
<p>2022 | 3700</p>
<p>Number of Tigers in India</p>
<p>Like pictographs, bar graphs give a nice visual way to represent data. They represent data through equally-spaced bars, each of equal width, where the lengths or heights give frequencies of the different categories.</p>
<p>Each category is represented by a bar where the length or height depicts the corresponding frequency (for example, cost) or quantity (for example, runs).</p>
<p>The bars have uniform spaces between them to indicate that they are free standing and represent equal categories.</p>
<p>The bars help in interpreting data much faster than a frequency table. By reading a bar graph, we can compare frequencies of different categories at a glance.</p>
<p>We must decide the scale (for example, 1 unit length = 1 student or 1 unit length = ₹ 200) for a bar graph on the basis of the data including the minimum and maximum frequencies, so that the resulting bar graph fits nicely and looks visually appealing on the paper or poster we are preparing. The markings of the unit lengths as per the scale must start from zero.</p>
<p>Teacher’s Note</p>
<p>The main focus of this chapter is to learn how to handle data to find answers to specific questions or inquiries, to test hypotheses or to take specific decisions. This should be kept in mind when providing practice opportunities to collect, organise and analyse data.</p>
<p>4.5 Artistic and Aesthetic Considerations</p>
<p>In addition to the steps described in previous sections, there are also some other more artistic and aesthetic aspects one can consider when preparing visual presentations of data to make them more interesting and effective. First, when making a visual presentation of data such as a pictograph or bar graph, it is important to make it fit in the intended space; this can be controlled, for example, by choosing the scale appropriately, as we have seen earlier. It is also desirable to make the data presentation visually appealing and easy-to-understand, so that the intended audience appreciates the information being conveyed.</p>
<p>Let us consider an example. Here is a table naming the tallest mountain on each continent, along with the height of each mountain in meters.</p>
<p>How much taller is Mount Everest than Mount Kosciuszko? Are Mount Denali and Mount Kilimanjaro very different in height? This is not so easy to quickly discern from a large table of numbers.</p>
<p>As we have seen earlier, we can convert the table of numbers into a bar graph, as shown on the right. Here, each value is drawn as a horizontal box. These are longer or shorter depending on the number they represent. This makes it easier to compare the heights of all these mountains at a glance.</p>
<p>Ganita Prakash | Grade 6</p>
<p>However, since the boxes represent heights, it is better and more visually appealing to rotate the picture, so that the boxes grow upward, vertically from the ground like mountains. A bar graph with vertical bars is also called a column graph. Columns are the pillars you find in a building that hold up the roof.</p>
<p>Below is a column graph for our table of tallest mountains. From this column graph, it becomes easier to compare and visualise the heights of the mountains.</p>
<p>Data Handling and Presentation</p>
<p>In general, it is more intuitive, suggestive and visually appealing to represent heights, that are measured upwards from the ground, using bar graphs that have vertical bars or columns. Similarly, lengths that are parallel to the ground (for example, distances between location on Earth) are usually best represented using bar graphs with horizontal arcs.</p>
<p>Figure it Out</p>
<p>1. If you wanted to visually represent the data of the heights of the tallest persons in each class in your school, would you use a graph with vertical bars or horizontal bars? Why?</p>
<p>2. If you were making a table of the longest rivers on each continent and their lengths, would you prefer to use a bar graph with vertical bars or with horizontal bars? Why? Try finding out this information, and then make the corresponding table and bar graph! Which continents have the longest rivers?</p>
<p>Infographics</p>
<p>When data visualisations such as bar graphs are further beautified with more extensive artistic and visual imagery, they are called information graphics or infographics for short. The aim of infographics is to make use of attention-attracting and engaging visuals to communicate information even more clearly and quickly, in a visually pleasing way.</p>
<p>As an example of how infographics can be used to communicate data even more suggestively, let us go back to the table above listing the tallest mountain on each continent. We drew a bar graph with vertical bars (columns) rather than horizontal bars, to be more indicative of mountains. But instead of rectangles, we could use triangles, which look a bit more like mountains. And, we can add a splash of colour as well. Here is the result.</p>
<p>Ganita Prakash | Grade 6</p>
<p>While this infographic might look more appealing and suggestive at first glance, it does have some issues. The goal of our bar graph earlier was to represent the heights of various mountains—using bars of the appropriate heights but the same widths. The purpose of using the same widths was to make it clear that we are only comparing heights. However, in this infographic, the taller triangles are also wider! Are taller mountains always wider? The infographic is implying additional information that may be misleading and may or may not be correct. Sometimes going for more appealing pictures can also accidentally mislead.</p>
<p>Taking this idea further, and to make the picture even more visually stimulating and suggestive, we can further change the shapes of the mountains to make them look even more like mountains, and add other details, while attempting to preserve the heights. For example, we can create an imaginary mountain range that contains all these mountains.</p>
<p>Is the infographic below better than the column graph with rectangular columns of equal width? The mountains look more realistic, but is the picture accurate?</p>
<p>For example, Everest appears to be twice as tall as Elbrus.</p>
<p>Data Handling and Presentation</p>
<p>The seven highest peaks on the seven continents.</p>
<p>What is 5642 × 2?</p>
<p>While preparing visually-appealing presentations of data, we also need to be careful that the pictures we draw do not mislead us about the facts. In general, it is important to be careful when making or reading infographics, so that we do not mislead our intended audiences and we, ourselves, are not misled.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>- Facts, numbers, measures, observations and other descriptions of things that convey information about those things is called data.<br>- Data can be organised in a tabular form using tally marks for easy analysis and interpretation.<br>- Frequencies are the counts of the occurrences of values, measures or observations.</p>
<p>Pictographs represent data in the form of pictures, or objects or parts of objects. Each picture represents a frequency which can be 1 or more than 1 — this is called the scale and it must be specified.</p>
<p>Bar graphs have bars of uniform width; the length or height that indicates the total frequency of occurrence. The scale that is used to convert length or height to frequency again, must be specified.</p>
<p>Choosing the appropriate scale for a pictograph or bar graph is important to accurately and effectively convey the desired information or data and to also make it visually appealing.</p>
<p>Other aspects of a graph also contribute to its effectiveness and visual appeal such as how colours are used, what accompanying pictures are drawn, and whether the bars are horizontal or vertical. These aspects correspond to the artistic and aesthetic side of data handling and presentation.</p>
<p>However, making visual representations of data ‘fancy’ can also sometimes be misleading.</p>
<p>By reading pictographs and bar graphs accurately, we can quickly understand and make inferences about the data presented.</p>

What may be the title of this table?<br>c. What caught your attention in this table?<br>d. In how many matches has Bumrah taken 4 wickets?<br>e. Mayank says “If we want to know the total number of wickets he has taken in his last 30 matches, we have to add the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3 …, up to 7.” Can Mayank get the total number of wickets taken in this way? Why?<br>f. How would you correctly figure out the total number of wickets taken by Bumrah in his last 30 matches, using this table?</p>
<p>Ans.<br>a. This table is giving the information about different number of wickets taken by Jaspreet Bumrah in different number of matches.<br>b. The title of this table may be: Wickets Taken by Jaspreet Bumrah in Last 30 Matches. (think of more!)<br>c. In this table, attention seeking point is that in 1 match 7 wickets were taken by Jaspreet Bumrah only. (think of more!)<br>d. In 3 matches Bumrah has taken 4 wickets.<br>e. No, Mayank can’t get the total number of wickets taken in this way. For example, 3 wickets per match were taken in 8 matches, which means total 24 wickets were taken.<br>f. To know the total number of wickets, prepare a next column of total wickets. It will have products of corresponding numbers of the two given columns. Then the sum of the numbers in the 3rd column, will be the total number of wickets. Total number of wickets = 90</p>

<p>Q.1. If you wanted to visually represent the data of the heights of the tallest persons in each class in your school, would you use a graph with vertical bars or horizontal bars? Why?</p>
<p>Ans. To present the data of the heights of the tallest persons in each class in a school, vertical bar graph is useful as heights of persons can be compared by heights of bars easily. (Although both bar graphs can be used.) (Think of more reasons!)</p>
<p>Q.2. If you were making a table of the longest rivers on each continent and their lengths, would you prefer to use a bar graph with vertical bars or with horizontal bars? Why? Try finding out this information, and then make the corresponding table and bar graph! Which continents have the longest rivers?</p>
<p>Ans. In this case, bar graph with horizontal bars is useful as length of a river is a horizontal feature, so lengths of rivers can be compared with lengths of horizontal bars easily. (Although both bar graphs can be used.) (Can you think of any other reasons?)</p>
