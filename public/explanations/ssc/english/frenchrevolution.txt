The French Revolution

The French Revolution began in 1789 and brought about a major change in France’s political and social structure. It ended absolute monarchy and established the idea of democracy and equality.

Before the Revolution, French society was divided into three estates: the First Estate (clergy), the Second Estate (nobility), and the Third Estate (commoners). The first two estates enjoyed privileges and paid no taxes, while the Third Estate—peasants, artisans, and middle-class professionals—bore the entire tax burden. Heavy taxes, food shortages, and social inequality created resentment among the common people.

King Louis XVI’s government faced financial crisis due to wars and extravagant spending. The Estates-General was called in 1789 to raise taxes, but representatives of the Third Estate demanded equal voting rights. When denied, they declared themselves the National Assembly and took the Tennis Court Oath, vowing to draft a constitution for France.

The Revolution’s major events included the storming of the Bastille on 14th July 1789, the abolition of feudal privileges, and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen. This declaration proclaimed liberty, equality, and fraternity as the new ideals of France. The king was executed in 1793, and France became a republic.

The Revolution also faced violence during the Reign of Terror under Robespierre, but later stability returned under the Directory. The revolution inspired democratic movements across the world and questioned the authority of monarchy and privilege. It marked the beginning of modern political thought and emphasized the importance of human rights and civic equality.
