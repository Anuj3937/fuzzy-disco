India: Size and Location

India is a vast country situated entirely in the Northern Hemisphere. It extends between latitudes 8°4'N and 37°6'N and longitudes 68°7'E and 97°25'E. The Tropic of Cancer (23°30'N) passes almost through the middle of India, dividing it into two nearly equal parts. The standard meridian of India, 82°30'E, passes through Mirzapur in Uttar Pradesh and is used as the reference for Indian Standard Time (IST).

India is the seventh-largest country in the world with an area of about 3.28 million square kilometers. It has a land frontier of about 15,200 km and a coastline (including islands) of over 7,500 km. To its north lie the mighty Himalayas, forming a natural barrier, while the southern part projects into the Indian Ocean, dividing it into the Arabian Sea on the west and the Bay of Bengal on the east.

India shares its borders with several countries: Pakistan and Afghanistan in the northwest, China, Nepal, and Bhutan in the north, and Bangladesh and Myanmar in the east. Across the sea, its neighbors include Sri Lanka (separated by the Palk Strait) and the Maldives in the southwest. This geographical location has always played a crucial role in India’s history, trade, and culture.

India’s central location between East and West Asia gives it a strategic advantage for trade. In ancient times, India’s trade routes across land and sea promoted cultural and commercial exchanges with Europe, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Its location has also made it a connecting link between different civilizations of the world.

The country’s vast size results in diverse physical features, climatic conditions, vegetation, and cultures. From the snow-covered Himalayas in the north to the coastal plains and plateaus in the south, India displays geographical diversity unmatched by many other nations. This diversity has influenced the way people live, dress, eat, and speak, creating a rich and varied cultural heritage.
