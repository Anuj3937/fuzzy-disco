Parliamentary Legislature and Executive

In India, the parliamentary system of government means that the legislature (Parliament) and the executive (Prime Minister and Council of Ministers) are linked. The Parliament is responsible for making laws, controlling finances, and checking the work of the government. It has two houses: the Lok Sabha (House of the People) and the Rajya Sabha (Council of States).

Members of the Lok Sabha are directly elected by the people through general elections. The Rajya Sabha represents the states and its members are elected by the state legislatures. Members discuss bills, ask questions, and hold debates to ensure government accountability.

The executive is headed by the Prime Minister, who is supported by a Council of Ministers. The Prime Minister is usually the leader of the majority party in the Lok Sabha. Ministers are responsible for specific departments and implement laws passed by Parliament. They are accountable to the legislature and must maintain its confidence to stay in office.

The parliamentary system ensures that the government is responsible to the people, allows discussion and scrutiny of policies, and helps maintain democratic principles. Understanding how the legislature and executive work helps citizens participate effectively and make informed choices
