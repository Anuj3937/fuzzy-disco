Chapter 2: The Invisible Living World — Beyond Our Naked Eye

This chapter explains the tiny world of microorganisms and cells that are invisible to our naked eyes. 
Humans discovered lenses and microscopes, which helped them see these small living beings. Robert Hooke first saw 
cells in cork and called them "cells," while Antonie van Leeuwenhoek was the first to observe microorganisms like bacteria.

All living organisms are made up of cells, which are the basic units of life. A cell has three main parts — the cell membrane, 
cytoplasm, and nucleus. Plant cells also have a cell wall and chloroplasts, while animal cells do not. Different types of 
cells have different shapes and functions, such as muscle cells that help movement and nerve cells that carry messages.

Microorganisms can be unicellular (like bacteria, Amoeba) or multicellular (like some fungi and algae). They are found 
everywhere — in air, water, soil, and even inside our bodies. Some are helpful, while others can cause diseases.

Useful microbes decompose dead plants and animals into nutrients, improving soil fertility and cleaning the environment. 
Bacteria like Rhizobium fix nitrogen in soil, and fungi help decompose organic matter. Microorganisms are used in food 
preparation too — yeast makes bread rise, and Lactobacillus turns milk into curd. Microalgae like Spirulina produce oxygen 
and are used as health food. Some bacteria even produce biogas or help clean oil spills.

Thus, microorganisms are essential for life. They recycle nutrients, support plant growth, make food, and maintain 
environmental balance.
