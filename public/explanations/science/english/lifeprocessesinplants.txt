Life Processes in Plants (Easy Notes)

• All living things need food, air, and water to grow.
• Plants make their own food — they do not eat like animals.
• Plants need sunlight, water, carbon dioxide, and chlorophyll to make food.
• This process is called photosynthesis.
• During photosynthesis:
    Sunlight + Water + Carbon dioxide → Glucose (food) + Oxygen
• Leaves are the ‘food factories’ of plants.
• Tiny pores called stomata help in exchange of gases.
• Water and minerals are absorbed by roots and carried to leaves through xylem.
• Food made in leaves is sent to other parts by phloem.
• Oxygen is released during photosynthesis — it is useful for all living beings.
• Plants also respire — they use oxygen and give out carbon dioxide.
• Respiration gives energy for growth and development.
• Thus, plants prepare food, transport it, and use it for energy.
