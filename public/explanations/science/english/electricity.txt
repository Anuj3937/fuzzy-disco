This chapter introduces the basics of how electricity flows and the essential components needed to make it work.

1. What is an Electric Cell and a Battery?
Electric Cell (or Dry Cell): This is the basic, portable source of electricity. It converts chemical energy into electrical energy.

It has two terminals: a positive terminal (+) and a negative terminal (-).

Battery: When two or more electric cells are connected together, it forms a battery.

For a cell to act as a battery, the positive terminal of one cell must be connected to the negative terminal of the next cell.

2. The Electric Circuit
An electric circuit is a complete and continuous path for an electric current to flow from one terminal of a cell (or battery) to the other.

Open Circuit (Switch OFF): If there is a break anywhere in the path, the circuit is incomplete, and no current flows. The bulb does not glow.

Closed Circuit (Switch ON): If the path is complete and continuous, current flows from the positive terminal to the negative terminal. The bulb glows.

Components: The main parts of a simple circuit are:

Source: Electric cell or battery.

Load: The device that uses electricity (e.g., a bulb).

Connecting Wires: Used to conduct (carry) the current.

Switch: Used to easily close (ON) or open (OFF) the circuit.

3. Conductors and Insulators
Materials are classified based on how easily electricity can pass through them.

Conductors: These are materials that allow electric current to pass through them easily. They complete the circuit.

Examples: Most metals like copper, aluminum, and iron.

Insulators: These are materials that do not allow electric current to pass through them. They break the circuit.

Examples: Rubber, plastic, wood, and paper.

Safety Note: Insulating materials like plastic are used to cover electrical wires to prevent shocks.

4. Heating Effect of Electric Current 🔥
When electric current flows through a wire, the wire gets hot. This is known as the heating effect of electric current.

Principle: The wire offers resistance to the flow of current, and this energy is converted into heat.

Applications (Devices that use this effect):

Electric Heater, Iron, Geyser: These devices use a special high-resistance wire (often an alloy like nichrome) that gets very hot when current passes through it.

Electric Fuse (Safety Device):

A fuse contains a thin wire that has a very low melting point.

If the current in the circuit becomes too high (due to a short circuit or overload), the thin wire melts and breaks the circuit.

This protects household wiring and appliances from damage.
