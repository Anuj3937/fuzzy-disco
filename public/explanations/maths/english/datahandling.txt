1. What is an Algebraic Expression?
It is a short and simple way to write mathematical ideas and relationships.

Instead of writing long sentences, we use letters (variables) and numbers (constants) along with basic operation signs (+, -, x, ÷).

Example: To say "Shabnam is 3 years older than Aftab," we can write the expression: Shabnam's Age = Aftab's Age + 3.

2. Letters are Variables (Literals)
The letters we use (like 'x', 'y', or 'n') are called variables or literals.

A variable is a quantity that does not have a fixed value; its value can change.

Think of it as an empty box: you can put any number inside the box.

The numbers (like 3, 5, 8) that have a fixed value are called constants.

3. How to Form Expressions
Expressions are formed by combining variables and numbers using basic mathematical operations:

Addition (+):

5 more than a number 'x' is written as x + 5.

Subtraction (-):

4 less than a number 'n' is written as n - 4.

Multiplication (x):

8 times a price 'c' is 8 x c. In algebra, we simply write this as 8c. (We usually drop the 'x' sign.)

Pattern Example: If it takes 2 matchsticks to make one 'L' shape, the expression for 'n' L-shapes is 2n.

4. Terms and Simplification
Terms: An expression is made up of different terms, separated by '+' or '-' signs. In 2l + 2b, the terms are 2l and 2b.

Like Terms: These are terms that have the same variable (e.g., 5c, 3c, 10c are like terms).

Simplifying: We can only add or subtract the like terms to make the expression shorter.

Example: 5c + 3c = 8c.

Unlike Terms: Terms with different variables (like 8c and 11d) cannot be added or simplified.

5. Evaluating an Expression
To evaluate an expression means to find its final numerical value.

We do this by substituting (putting) a specific number in place of the variable.

Example: If the expression is 5m + 3 and m is 2, you calculate: (5 x 2) + 3 = 13.
