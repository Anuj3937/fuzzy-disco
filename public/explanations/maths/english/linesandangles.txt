This chapter, titled "We Distribute, Yet Things Multiply," centers on the **distributive property** of multiplication over addition, expressed algebraically as $a(b+c) = ab + ac$. The core focus is using this property to understand and calculate the change in a product when one or both factors are incremented or decremented, leading to the general identity: $(a+m)(b+n) = ab + mb + an + mn$. The text establishes that such algebraic statements are called **identities** and that they hold true for integers, including negative numbers. A significant section applies the distributive property to develop quick multiplication techniques, such as multiplying by 11 or 101, by factoring the multiplier (e.g., $11 = 10+1$). Finally, the chapter introduces and proves three crucial special case identities, often visualized geometrically: the **square of a sum** $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$, the **square of a difference** $(a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$, and the **difference of squares** $(a+b)(a-b) = a^2 - b^2$. The chapter also briefly notes the historical use of this property by ancient Indian mathematicians like Brahmagupta.
