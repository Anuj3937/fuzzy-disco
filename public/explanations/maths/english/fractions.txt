1. Multiplying a Whole Number by a Fraction
This is like repeated addition.


Concept: Multiplying a whole number (like 3) by a fraction (like  
4
1
​
 ) is the same as adding the fraction to itself that many times.


Example: Distance covered in 3 hours at  
4
1
​
  km/hr is: 3× 
4
1
​
 = 
4
1
​
 + 
4
1
​
 + 
4
1
​
 = 
4
3
​
  km.


The Rule: To multiply a fraction by a whole number, you only multiply the numerator (top number) by the whole number, and the denominator (bottom number) remains the same.

Formula: Whole Number × 
Denominator
Numerator
​
 = 
Denominator
Whole Number×Numerator
​
 

2. Multiplying a Fraction by a Fraction
When you multiply two fractions, you are finding a "fraction of a fraction."


Concept: Multiplying  
2
1
​
  by  
4
1
​
  means finding  
2
1
​
  of  
4
1
​
 .

If you divide  
4
1
​
  into two equal parts, each part is  
8
1
​
 .


Result:  
2
1
​
 × 
4
1
​
 = 
8
1
​
 .


The Simple Rule (The Rule of Products): To multiply any two fractions, follow these two steps:

Multiply the numerators together.

Multiply the denominators together.


Formula:  
b
a
​
 × 
d
c
​
 = 
b×d
a×c
​
 .

3. Key Concepts for Calculation

Mixed Fractions: If a number is a mixed fraction (like 1 
4
1
​
 ), you must first convert it into an improper fraction (like  
4
5
​
 ) before you can multiply it.



Area Model: The product (answer) of multiplying two fractions can be seen as the area of a rectangle whose sides are equal to the two fractions.



Simplifying (Cancelling): It is often easier to simplify the fractions before you multiply them.

You can divide any numerator and any denominator by their common factor. This process is called "cancelling."


Example: In  
7
12
​
 × 
24
5
​
 , you can divide 12 (numerator) and 24 (denominator) by their common factor 12 to make the calculation simpler.
