This chapter, "Quadrilaterals," introduces four-sided figures, deriving the word from Latin words quadri (four) and latus (sides). It begins by defining a **Rectangle** as a quadrilateral with all right (90°) angles and equal opposite sides. A key deduction shows that a quadrilateral is a rectangle if and only if its **diagonals are equal and bisect each other**. The chapter then introduces the **Square** as a special rectangle where all sides are equal. Its diagonals are equal, bisect each other, and intersect at **90° (right angles)**, also bisecting the square's angles. Furthermore, the text establishes the general property that the **sum of all angles in any quadrilateral is 360°**. Building on this, the concept of a **Parallelogram**—a quadrilateral with parallel opposite sides—is introduced, and it is proven that its opposite sides and angles are equal, and its diagonals bisect each other. Finally, the **Rhombus** is defined as a quadrilateral with all sides equal (a special parallelogram). Its unique property is that its diagonals bisect each other at **90°** and also bisect its angles. The relationships are summarized: Squares are both Rectangles and Rhombuses, and all three are Parallelograms.
