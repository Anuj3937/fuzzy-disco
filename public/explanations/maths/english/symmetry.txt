This chapter focuses on looking at the structure of numbers and using simple math rules to solve puzzles.1. The General Form of NumbersEvery number can be written based on the place value of its digits. This is called the general form.Two-Digit Number: A number like 52 can be written as $10 \times 5 + 2$. In general, a number with digits $a$ and $b$ is written as $10a + b$. The digit $a$ is in the tens place and $b$ is in the units place.Three-Digit Number: A number like 345 can be written as $100 \times 3 + 10 \times 4 + 5$. In general, a number with digits $a, b,$ and $c$ is written as $100a + 10b + c$.2. Games with Reversing NumbersWe can find special divisibility rules when we reverse the digits of a number.Rule for Two Digits (Subtraction): If you take a two-digit number, reverse its digits, and then subtract the smaller number from the larger one, the result is always exactly divisible by 9.Example: Start with 73. Reverse it to get 37. Subtract: $73 - 37 = 36$. Since $36 \div 9 = 4$, the rule holds.Rule for Two Digits (Addition): If you add a two-digit number and its reversed number, the sum is always exactly divisible by 11.Example: Start with 54. Reverse it to get 45. Add: $54 + 45 = 99$. Since $99 \div 11 = 9$, the rule holds.3. Puzzles with Letters (Finding Digits)In these puzzles, letters are used to represent unknown digits, and your task is to find the value (0 to 9) of each letter that makes the arithmetic problem correct.Rule 1: Each letter in the puzzle must stand for only one single digit. For example, if A is 7, then every A in the problem must be 7.Rule 2: The digit in the first place (the left-most digit) of a number cannot be zero. For instance, in the number AB, A cannot be 0.Method: You solve these puzzles by systematically trying out the possible single-digit values (0 to 9) for the letters, keeping in mind the rules of column addition or multiplication and carrying over.4. Simple Divisibility RulesDivisibility rules are shortcuts to check if one number can be perfectly divided by another without leaving a remainder.Divisibility by 2: A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is an even number (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8).Divisibility by 3: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of all its digits is divisible by 3. For example, for 414, the sum is $4+1+4=9$. Since 9 is divisible by 3, 414 is also divisible by 3.Divisibility by 5: A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5.Divisibility by 9: This is similar to the rule for 3. A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of all its digits is divisible by 9.Divisibility by 10: A number is divisible by 10 if its last digit is 0.
