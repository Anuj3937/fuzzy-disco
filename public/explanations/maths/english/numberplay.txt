A square number is the product of a number multiplied by itself. For example, 2 × 2 = 4, 3 × 3 = 9, 4 × 4 = 16, and so on. The process of multiplying a number by itself is called squaring the number. Similarly, a cube number is obtained when a number is multiplied by itself three times. For example, 2 × 2 × 2 = 8, 3 × 3 × 3 = 27, etc. The process of multiplying a number three times by itself is known as cubing the number.
A number that can be expressed as the square of an integer is known as a perfect square, and one that can be expressed as the cube of an integer is a perfect cube.
For example, 49 is a perfect square because 7 × 7 = 49, and 64 is a perfect cube because 4 × 4 × 4 = 64.
Perfect squares always end with digits 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9. No perfect square ends with 2, 3, 7, or 8. The square root of a number is the value which, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. Similarly, the cube root of a number is the value which, when used three times in multiplication, gives the original number.
To check if a number is a perfect square or cube, we use prime factorization. A number is a perfect square if all its prime factors occur in pairs, and a perfect cube if all prime factors occur in triplets.
